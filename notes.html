  <h3>How Airplanes Fly - Wings</h3>
  
  <img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-199710d55ac9a3165ce2d56953e59739">
  
  Airplane wings has a high pressure area under the wings with a low pressure area on the top of the wings. The top of the airplane wings is shaped
  to make air move faster over the wings. This makes the pressure on top of the wing lesser than the pressure under the wing. The difference in pressure
  creates a force on the wing that lifts the airplane into the air.

	<h2 id="nuclear">Nuclear Fission & Fusion</h2>
	
	<b>Fission</b>
	
	The current model for nuclear fission occurs when a neutron hits Uranium-235 or Plutonium-238. Once hit, the Uranium-235 splits into Barium-141, Krypton-95 and 3 
	excited neutrons.
	
	<b>Fusion</b>
	
	The current model for nuclear fusion occurs when the hydrogen isotopes, deuterium (hydrogen with 1 neutron) and tritium (hydrogen with 2 neutrons) are made to
	collide with each other under intense plasma heat. The plasma breaks the Coloumb's barrier, allowing the isotopes to collide with ease - forming a helium 
	(2 protons and 2 neutrons) and 1 excited neutron. The plasma are contained either through tokamaks or stellarator machines. To heat the plasma, 3 methods 
	may be used: ohmic heating, neutral beam injection and RF heating.
	
	The tokamaks rely on toroidal magnetic field to keep the plasma together while the stellarators rely on helical coils to maintain the plasma together.
	
	<h2 id="transformers">Transformers</h2>
	
	Transformers in LLM reads a large amount of text as a whole at once. They either assign numbers and symbols on the text (tokenization), give scores on which text is 
	important (attention scores), give numbers to indicate
	which position the text is (position encoding). A transformer consists of stack and is layered through one another. The key components of the layers are Multi-Head 
	Self-Attention (focuses on relationships between
	words or tokens) and Feed-Forward Network (processes and refines the information obtained from attention).
	
	How stacking works?
	
	First Layer: You focus on basic shapes and colors - low-level features.
	Second Layer: You notice patterns, like how shapes combine to form objects.
	Third Layer: You start understanding the context e.g., the painting depicts a forest scene.
	Final Layer: You grasp the abstract meaning, like the painters's emotional expression.
	
	1. Input Representation - Each token is a vector representing the word or subword in the context of the sequence.
	
	2. Self-Attention and FFN - The self-attention mechanism recalibrates each token's embedding by considering its relationships to other tokens. The feed-forward 
	network 
	applies transformations that enhance the embedding's depth and abstraction.
	
	3. Residual Connection - Each layer also adds a shortcut path (called a residual connection), bypassing its own computations and adding the input to the output.
	4. Layer Normalization - At each layer, normalization is applied to stabilize training and ensure that inputs to the next layer remain well-scaled.
	5. Stacking Continues - This process is repeated layer by layer, with each one refining the token representations further.
	6. Final Output - After all layers, the final token embeddings are used for predictions (e.g., the next word, text classification, etc.).
	
	<h2 id="telnet-ssh">Telnet vs. SSH</h2>
	
	SSH stands for <b>Secure Shell</b> while Telnet stands for <b>Telecommunications and Networks</b>. They are used as a method for secure remote log-in
	from one computer to another.
	
	SSH uses port 22 however the port can be changed while Telnet uses port 23 by default. SSH is sent by encrypted form while Telnet is less secure.
	Telnet transfers data in text form while SSH uses Encrypted format to send data over a secure channel. SSH has required authentication while Telnet
	doesn't require any authentication. SSH is used in public networks while Telnet is used in private networks only.
	
	<h2 id="alternating-current">Alternating Current</h2>
	
	Alternating current (AC) is a type of electric current in which the flow of electronics switches back and forth at regular intervals. AC is used
	primarily in power distribution. It also changes magnitude with time, unlike direct current (DC) which only flows in one direction.

	<h2 id="thermodynamics">Thermodynamics</h2>
	
	<h3>The Four Laws of thermodynamics</h3>
	
	Zeroth law - If two systems are in thermodynamic equilibrium with a third system, the two original systems are in thermal equilibrium with
	one another.
	
	1st law - Energy can be converted from one form to another but it cannot be created nor destroyed, under any circumstances.
	
	2nd law - State of entropy of the entire system, as an isolated system, will increase over time. Changes in the entropy in the universe
	can never be negative.
	
	3rd law - The value of entropy of a completely pure crystalline substance is zero at absolute zero temperature.

	<h2 id="heat-transfer">Heat Transfer</h2>
	
	Heat transfer in 3 ways:
	
	1. Conduction - Heat is transferred by direct contact.
	
	2. Convection - Heat is transferred by movement of fluids and gas.
	
	3. Radiation - Heat is transferred through electro-magnetic waves.
	
	<b>How is heat transferred by convection?</b>
	
	1) Water is heated.
	
	2) Hot water at the bottom rises while colder water from the top sinks to the bottom.
	
	3) Repeat process until the water/fluid is entirely hot.
	
	<b>How is heat transferred by convection?</b>
	
	Heat energy is transferred by collisions through atoms or molecules. When a solid absorbs heat, its atoms vibrate faster, 
	these vibrations are transferred from atom to atom, creating heat. 
	
	<b>How heat is transferred by radiation?</b>
	
	Bodies such as the Sun emit thermal radiation due to movement of atoms and molecules. These particles emit electro-magnetic radiation
	and heat is transferred by these electro-magnetic waves. Heat transfer through radiation does not need a medium to transfer heat.
	
	<h2 id="quantum-computer">Quantum Computer</h2>
	
	<h3>Types of Quantum computers</h3>
	
	1. Superconducting
	
	2. Photonic
	
	3. Trapped Ions
	
	4. Neutral Atoms
	
	5. Quantum Dots
	
	<h2 id="atoms">Atoms</h2>
	
	Atoms are the smallest unit of matter. They are made of nucleus (which contains the neutrons and protons) and the electrons that orbits the nucleus.
	The neutrons and protons are made of particles called quarks while electrons are made of particles called leptons. Neutrons have 2 down quarks and 1
	up quark while protons have 2 up quarks and 1 down quark.
	
	Baryonic matters are made of 3 quarks while mesons are made of 1 quark and 1 anti-quark. Protons and neutrons are baryonic matter.
